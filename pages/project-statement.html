      <p>&emsp;If you’ve heard me lecture or just say literally anything before you’ve probably heard me talk about <a href="http://www.encyclopedia.chicagohistory.org/pages/426.html" target="_blank">Greater Englewood</a>, where I am originally from and where much of my immediate family still lives. The first presentation I ever gave at the <a href="https://arhu.umd.edu">University of Maryland, College Park</a> was an <a href="https://bit.ly/growing-greater">AADHum Open Lab</a> on <a href="http://www.emaphd.com/freelance/growing-a-greater-englewood/">“Growing a Greater Englewood"</a>, an audio story I co-produced that examined the neighborhood and its justice organizations. The piece reflects so many of the things about Greater Englewood that I find so fascinating as a distant resident and researcher. The dominant narrative of the neighborhood, like many on the South and West sides of the city, like many urban cities, is one of violence, trauma, and destitution. The bright ones escape, and everyone else is left to rot. This is a narrative believed by many outsiders, who only learn about the neighborhood from sensational news stories. The story is also believed by many insiders, who have a much more complex experience of this working-class Black and Brown community but learn the same story of ruin from the media reinforced by their experiences of real structural inequality, shaped by years of neglect and disinvestment.</p>
      
      <!-- [img - GGE space] -->
      
      <p>&emsp;As such, much of the Southside Chicago social justice work I encounter involves a storytelling component, no matter what the core issue is. For example, <a href="https://www.growgreater.org">Grow Greater Englewood</a>, the organization profiled in the audio story, is a land and food justice organization that grounds its work in historical recovery through storytelling. Their belief is that in addition to land and food, community residents must be rooted in their full, radical, sustainable history in order to bloom new futures. If the only stories residents ever learn about themselves are negative, how can the community count on anything to improve? Social justice means growing and sustaining culture as much as it means ending structural oppression; giving the people their bread, and their roses too.</p>
      
      <p>&emsp;This narrative work is increasingly being done by community members through digital and new media platforms. Ivory tower academics aren’t the only folks exploring and expanding the human condition through digital methodologies. In addition to growing food and teaching residents how to grow their own food, and creating digital media with other organizations, Grow Greater Englewood has plans to create their own virtual reality experience showcasing their local farm/meeting space and sharing narratives by community members, allowing anyone anywhere to experience Greater Englewood on its residents’ own terms.</p>
      
      <p>&emsp;Before I encountered Grow Greater Englewood and contemporary Southside Chicago justice work though, I was a distant resident and researcher. I call myself a distant resident because I always say that I am from the Southside of Chicago, no matter where I actually live and no matter who is asking. I claim Southside Chicago because it is important to me that others encounter the neighborhood as a real place producing living breathing humans and not simply a media metaphor for urban decay (I do what I can with the little power I have). To be clear, the desolation of structural disinvestment is a very real force in the community, but so is the power of care and the possibility of joy, exhibited in the work of organizations like Grow Greater Englewood. This orientation informs all my work; I am incredibly curious about this little neighborhood thriving at the nexus of Black power and anti-Black oppression. There’s a little piece of every project I’ve made that explores this curiosity, Easter eggs for the folks in the know. How could something so neglected be so beautiful, full of spirit? <i>WILDWOOD</i> first seeded itself in my mind as a project diving head-first into this curiosity, seeking to make sense of that dichotomy.</p>

      <sub> <a href="#fn1">1</a></sub>
      
      <p>I have always found myself grounded in Greater Englewood; by comparison, I am brand new to the world of tabletop role playing games. As many people probably did, I read choose-your-own-adventure Goosebumps stories as a kid, but I didn’t get deeper into the world of gamebooks and definitely never tried playing tabletop role playing games, I am not sure I even knew what they were until pretty recently. I thought that choose-your-own-adventure novels were vaguely interesting, but never really encountered or sought out the genre after childhood. I didn’t actually get into narrative- based games until I was writing my dissertation. Podcasts were a major mental distraction from the endless pages before me, and one of my favorite podcasts follows a group of brothers and their dad playing tabletop role playing games. They play different games now, but the first couple of seasons were all centered on Dungeons & Dragons. I was hesitant to check out the podcast at first because I only knew D&D as its stereotype, the domain of wizard-cloaked white men in dark basements, but decided to give it a listen anyway. I am glad that I did. Not only is a forty-plus episode season of anything an awesome distraction from work, but the show totally shifted my misconceptions about D&D and tabletop role playing games in general.</p>

      <p>I had never played a role playing game but I (and surely many other listeners) learned the basics as the brothers taught their dad how to play throughout season one. I learned the general contours of the field: role playing games are games where players take a character role and play through a story sketched out by a game master or GM, collaboratively advancing the narration through player choices and often dice rolls. Role-playing games come in many forms, including in person and online; tabletop role playing games take place around a table, and as such are heavily narrative (as opposed to being physical). Gamebooks, of which choose-your-own-adventures are a part, are similar in that they facilitate a narrative shaped by player choice, but a player’s choices are restricted to what is written in the text; a true tabletop role playing game allows for endless choices, within the world created by the GM. In each structure, choices and actions are met with reactions, which trigger a player to choose to act, and the game narrative grows.</p>

      <p>On a basic level, being able to create and act within a totally made-up fantasy world is actually very fun, as a player, as a GM, and even as an observer. It’s even better when the players and GM are all comedians, as is the case with the D&D podcast. More importantly, encountering table top role playing games showed me the possibilities of telling the story of a journey through a world, a journey involving collaboration (between the players and the GM), accountability (in that players are responsible for the consequences of their actions), and luck; a framework for playtesting life. This year is the 50th anniversary of the release of Dungeons & Dragons, and I have seen numerous articles profiling different groups, from autistic children6 to connection- starved adults during the pandemic7 to former athletes8 to Texas death row inmates9, using the game as a tool of real-world healing, connection, and presence through storytelling and problem solving, even as it is an escape into a fictional world.</p>
      
      <p>This is why I find role playing games so critical. It’s less about being able to act out a story as an elven warrior princess, though the universe could certainly use more Black queer elven warrior princesses (and yes, I would still choose to be Black and queer even in a fantasy universe). It’s the real-life collective worldbuilding for me. Outlined by Karen Schrier, Evan Torner, and Jessica Hammer in their article “Worldbuilding in Role- Playing Games,” worldbuilding combines the “act of designing and constructing believable fictional universes” with the “process of...link[ing] together individual stories scattered across multiple media”10. Worldbuilding offers fictional universe rules within which characters can write their own stories, collaboratively building a new universe as individual stories branch and intersect. Players are dropped into a skeletal world sketched by the GM, and the world is fleshed through actions and reactions, much like reality. And yet, though players meet as characters in a fictional world, this engagement serves to re-imagine if not “re-enchant”11 the real world; as the authors posit, “most fictional worlds present us with lenses with which to view familiar aspects of our own that have been accentuated, transformed, and lain bare”12. Even as we create fictional worlds, those worlds are still constructed in relation to the world we occupy, calling into question elements of our own reality by playing through a narrative of their escape.</p>
      
      <p>In worldbuilding, power is play, just as play is power. As digital humanities superstar turned beauty guru Adeline Koh wrote in her foundational essay “The Political Power of Play,” “to reimagine the world is to create the potential to change it. Play is, in brief, serious business. To play is to imagine; to imagine is political because it allows us to envision a different order, a different system, a different way to separate economic resources and power”13. Playing through worldbuilding offers space for any dream about what society could be to become a temporary reality, and asks that participants imagine how they might reach that world and how they would live once they got there. Predictably, granting people the space to build the world they want to see does not end well 100% of the time; two well-known examples are the role playing game about a global holy race war and the role playing game that relishes in using highly explicit and violent rape as a central combat action (and those are just games that have been published and sold for real money). Games this horrifying appear to be a rarity among the genre, though.</p>
      
      <p>A more common theme is marginalized members of society constructing worlds that minimize or eliminate their oppression, using the game as a space to craft and play through a liberated futurity. For example, the Deep Forest table top role playing game (which I first encountered during an awesomely affirming If,Then lecture on Gaming as Speculative Worldbuilding14 by Alexandra To and Chris Martens) is a “map game of post-colonial weird fantasy” set in a world where the “invading humans” that “occupied...our monstrous home” have been “driven off” and we have “a year of relative peace...with which to dismantle their settlements and reclaim our lands”. We only have one year to complete this work because “come Winter, a band of heroes will arrive and we might not survive the encounter,” the ending of the game, but “right now, in this moment, we monsters have an opportunity for healing and self-discovery in our deep forest, away from human eyes”15. The game takes seriously what it means and looks like to rebuild a community after decolonization and calls attention to the relative fragility of postcoloniality, requiring that players examine the materially damaging effects of colonialism and envision healing alternatives, and it does so from the perspective of the “monster,” challenging colonial discourse by owning and inverting it. Unfortunately I didn’t get to participate in gameplay as I was watching a recording of the live event, which itself took place on Zoom. Even just as an observer I was struck by watching others start with a blank Google Slide and literally draw a map of their Deep Forest world, a world on the brink of liberation yet still fully mapped through its colonial past. Building this world meant initially thinking like a colonizer, in order to then play against the colonizer, which I think really hits at the powerful possibilities of playing through worldbuilding. Here, play is not simply envisioning but truly enacting new social orders, new systems, new economies, new power structures, new rules, grounded in a nuanced understanding of the world against which one writes, with the added benefit of being able to immediately improve what is broken and discard what does not work simply by shifting the story. Even if that enactment is only for a few hours a week and only exists at a friend’s table or in a lecturer’s Google Slides account, it still serves as practice for creating and inhabiting a new future in all of its messy and complex detail.</p>

      <p>For those of us at the margins, this play is a critical practice. As adrienne maree brown writes in Emergent Strategies: Shaping Change, Changing Worlds, “we must imagine new worlds that transition ideologies and norms, so that no one sees Black people as murderers, or Brown people as terrorists and aliens, but all of us as potential cultural and economic innovators. [...] This is collaborative ideation — what are the ideas that will liberate all of us? The more people that collaborate on that ideation, the more that people will be served by the resulting world(s). Science fiction is simply a way to practice the future together...emergent strategies are ways for humans to practice complexity and grow the future through relatively simple interactions”16. Worldbuilding is not just a fun escape, it is an emergent strategy for collectively envisioning and growing new futures through play, for immersively practicing the ideas and skill sets that will liberate us all. It was for this reason that I opened my Black speculative literature class one year with an icebreaker in the form of a choose-your-own-adventure madlibs story, having students imagine that ground zero of the apocalypse was our campus building and they suddenly had to figure out how to to survive. This was a great way to get to know my students as the story asked them to fill in details about themselves, but it was also a great way to get my students in the mindset of envisioning speculative futurity by actually playing through it on the page as a main character. When we then read Black speculative texts and media across the semester, students had a broader vision of what it looked like to enact futurity.</p>

      <p>Table top role playing games are exciting to consider for their imaginative possibilities, but actually playing them is a different story. Gameplay works best when it is collaborative, meaning you need other people to play with. Except, back when I was first introduced to D&D, none of my friends and family wanted to play with me and I didn’t have the mental bandwidth to find a group to play with, too busy writing a dissertation in a global pandemic. Many of my friends and family shared my initial misgivings—D&D, and table top role playing games in general, are only for supernerds of a certain gender and complexion. But by then I knew better. On the one hand I was frustrated because many of those folks watch Stranger Things, a wildly popular show heavily based on D&D; clearly the game is relatable to a broad audience. On the other hand I understood where they were coming from. This response reflects the stereotype of the game, which itself reflects the extent to which Black folks do or do not imagine themselves as actors within science fiction worlds. The rise of Afrofuturism as a mainstream cultural force from its emergence on the aesthetic margins has certainly helped Black folks see themselves in fantastical futures--many of my friends and family who would never be caught playing D&D are just as ready to pack up and move to Wakanda. As much as I enjoy consuming Black speculative media though, I wanted to actually participate in the collaborative ideation that might produce a radical Black future rather than just watch someone else’s vision, but I didn’t know how to get there.</p>

      <p>So, these disparate ideas about Chicago futures and worldbuilding simmered while I built skills and worked on other projects. In time, the ideas bumped against a new media through which they could manifest.</p>

      <p>WILDWOOD’s seeds began to root and sprout in the dirt of Black digital and experimental methods. For me, BlackDH is the intertwining of methodology and theory in service of “interrogating and mapping” and refashioning the complicated relationship between technology and the African Diaspora. According to literature scholar Kimberly Bain from our article “The Street Finds Its Uses: a Black Digital Humanities Call and Response,” Black DH is a “call to study how we read, how we think, and how we become invested”17 in anti-Black systems of thinking and knowing. My Black digital humanities practice involves using and understanding technology in relation to and in service of Black self-narrative, Black community (re)creation, and Black world making. For example, the above analysis comes from an article written with a dear friend; as is a common theme in my BlackDH community, that article began as a way for us to better understand our own relationship to and personal histories of the technologies we interact with. This view of BlackDH is core to the work that we do at AADHum18, as we explore the intersection of “digital studies—producing scholarship that evaluates and extends investigations into the histories and impacts of digital technologies on Black lifeworlds” and “the ideation and production of projects that actively name blackness in the production and implementation of digital technologies.”19</p>

      <p>The end result of being called to interrogate and refashion how we think and produce Black and digital together is not simply breaking apart what already exists, not simply turning away from, but the creation of something new. Fundamentally, BlackDH demands that we create with an eye toward the affordances of digital technologies and the lessons of cultural knowledge. As AADHum director Marisa Parham explains in “Breaking, dancing, making in the machine: notes on .break .dance,” reflecting on a conversation about digital humanist work with an indigenous scholar colleague & friend, BlackDH explores “what digital affordances could bring to Black diasporic texts...Not because the texts were necessarily resistant or because we were unsure, but because we wanted so desperately to have critical forms that could sometimes show and not tell, forms that could express relationality differently, that could foreground media materiality, and because we both come from traditions wherein direct telling and explication are less valued than other modes of knowledge transfer.”20</p>

      <p>When I think about cultural knowledge of Black expressive traditions, and how to name Blackness in digital production, my mind often goes to Black feminist scholar Barbara Christian’s claim that we are a race for theory, “but in forms quite different from the Western form of abstract logic...our theorizing (and I intentionally use the verb rather than the noun) is often in narrative forms, in the stories we create, in riddles and proverbs, in the play with language, since dynamic rather than fixed ideas seem more to our liking. How else have we managed to survive with such spiritedness...women, at least the women I grew up around, continually speculated about the nature of life through pithy language that unmasked the power relations of the world. It is this language, and the grace and pleasure with which they played with it, that I find celebrated, refined, critiqued in the work...a written figure which is both sensual and abstract, both beautiful and communicative”21. I’m interested in the capacity of digital humanities methods to create dynamic texts both sensual and abstract, beautiful and communicative, in response to the power relations of the world, with spirit, grace, and pleasure; in other words, to worldbuild.</p>

      <p>Of course, there is a well-documented digital humanities history of worldbuilding through dynamic textual production, with UMD as one hub of activity. MITH22 houses the Deena Larsen Collection, an archive of early electronic literature community and authorship. Larsen, a pioneering new media and hypertext author, is best known for her 1993 hypertext poetry collection Marble Springs23. The collection tells the story of women living in a fictional Colorado mining town during the Gold Rush, trying to build a new world in a moment of major social transformation with men on the margins. Individual pieces in the collection are hyperlinked together in order to “bring the deep hidden weaving of relationships between women...to the forefront of a reader’s imagination,” in order to “show the links...the connections”24. Here, digital interactivity allows us to not just imagine but actually move through the intricacies of community creation, bound by the conventions of a world. It’s not only about what the connections are, but how you as a reader or player are called to participate, navigate the connections, and even insert yourself into the narrative.</p>

      <p>At AADHum, dynamic digital narrative creation is a key framework for navigating the intricacies of Black lifeworlds. For example, my colleague Andrew Smith’s LiteraryDJ,25 a “digital remixing engine born out of Black literary and musical practices” allows users to move through a set of Hip hop lyrics and Black literary texts “as a pathway for understanding the ties between Black musical and literary traditions as repositories of storytelling, cultural memory, and history26”. The engine encourages users to link lyrics and literature together to build textual playlists according to shared key terms. Users actively remix disparate Black cultural sources into a narrative around a given word, navigating the connections between the different pieces and immersing themselves in a visualization of Black life.</p>

      <p>But what if, immersed in a visualization of Black life, a user is denied interaction because links and connections have been systematically erased? My colleague Christin Washington’s Dare to Remember: A Digital Memorial of Black Brooklyn 27“re-envisions ways to represent black histories after erasure, disappearance, and silencing. [...] us[ing] GIS mapping, a photo series, and virtual reality to create this immersive, digital, commemorative experience and to emphasize the importance of memory and transgenerational silence to Brooklyn’s black community.”28 The project digitally maps one community through its historical and cultural silences, telling a story of Black Brooklyn partially by mediating the reader’s ability to interact with and connect to an immersive environment. Drawing upon a desire for the intimacy of interactivity, the author interrogates our assumption that we have agency over and inherent connection to our built environment by “manufactur[ing] th[e] initial feeling of incommunicable frustration and recurring feelings of disorientation” through which the author experiences her neighborhood and its shifts over time.29 </p>

      <p>Failing connection, we can log on to visualize a new world altogether. Parham’s Let Us Be Weightless30, an interactive short story, builds a world that “thinks digital ecologies from the perspective of people of color in the Americas”.31 Though the hypertext narrative builds a world that looks similar to ours, those similarities shift as expected connections lead to new outcomes. These shifts take place in the narrative and in the interface, as the project pushes Twine’s platform boundaries to challenge not only a reader’s understanding of American ecology, but also their understanding of digital reading practice, both experiments key to the future of our world. A dynamic text, sensual and abstract, responding to the power relations of the world and its ecologies by creating a new world to play in (even if only for an hour or two).</p>

      <p>BlackDH brought me back to WILDWOOD. Inspired by Christian’s call to create dynamic texts with spirit, grace, and pleasure, and affirmed by my colleagues’ groundbreaking digital work toward “enhanc[ing], even sometimes transform[ing] the kinds of networks out of which we have ourselves emerged,”32 the project builds a digital narrative gameworld that shifts in response to the player’s choices and her luck (in the form of dice rolls). Writing this work of interactive fiction is a way for me to play a table top role playing game with myself, moving between the roles of GM, player, and observer as I iteratively build a world, create conflict, envision responses, and parse the results. Though the world is not collaborative in the sense that a reader can add to the story, WILDWOOD invites the reader to play with me in the practice of envisioning and enacting new stories about Greater Englewood. Specifically, afro-solarpunk stories.</p>

      <p>Why this particular genre? Solarpunk has been an aesthetic interest of mine for a while now. Solarpunk culture envisions a radically sustainable world where humanity and technology work in concert with the environment instead of against it, demanding the disavowal of un- and anti-sustainable capitalist structures. This can take many shapes and function at many scales, from fully off the grid eco-village living to neighborhood composting services, but is grounded in grassroots collective organizing; sustainability for the people, by the people. I first encountered the term while researching cyberpunk culture and its connections to Afrofuturism; cyberpunk led me to all of the different kinds of punk, which led me to solarpunk. Solarpunk aesthetics are almost completely overgrown with wild flora and fauna, but not entirely; a visualization of balance between the built and natural environments. Afro-solarpunk places Black life and culture at the center of this visualization.</p>

      <p>I almost immediately began imagining what a solarpunk Englewood would look like; what if every vacant lot was a forage garden and every abandoned building a solar- powered greenhouse? How would the community be different, and how would it stay the same? Initially an aesthetic thought experiment, I began to spend afternoons convened with Englewood activists and evenings binging role playing games. I visited the Englewood Nature Trail33, a stretch of abandoned freight train tracks anchored by the Grow Greater Englewood farmland purposefully allowed to grow over and re-wild into an elevated nature preserve, and realized that folks were already experimenting with strategies to enact the afro-solarpunk future I envisioned. Over time the question shifted: how might I imagine and write a world where Greater Englewood has solved some of the world’s greatest environmental challenges? How can I help to flesh the skeletal world these community leaders have already begun to sketch? How might I construct a future narrative for a neighborhood that is very invested in and actively works toward social and environmental futurity but is rarely spoken of as such? 
        
      footnote: As an aside, the first title I came up with for this project was Good Dragons, Mad Dungeons, a mashup of D&D’s title with Kendrick Lamar’s album title Good Kid, M.A.A.D. City, also the name of a Chicago youth activist organization. I dropped the title as the project evolved away from using Dungeons & Dragons as a role playing game structure, but Good Dragons, Mad Dungeons was one of my better creative moments now memorialized in this talk.</p>

      <p>Worldbuilding in this way is the work of intersectional environmentalism, defined by organizer and eco-communicator Leah Thomas in her book The Intersectional Environmentalist as “environmentalism that advocates for the protection of both people and the planet...[it] also aims to create space for a more complete and inclusive retelling of environmental or natural history, one that embraces all cultural contributors to sustainability and environmentalism”34. Environmental justice requires not only new actions and new structures, but new stories about how they intertwine to fashion our surroundings, grounded in lessons of history.</p>

      <p>However, this is a particularly generative question given the role that the Southside of Chicago plays in environmental justice history. Hazel Johnson, a pioneering environmental activist, began organizing for no other reason than to improve her community’s environmental conditions. A resident of Altgeld Gardens, a project housing development on the far southside, Johnson began investigating when she realized that a disproportionate amount of her community, including her husband, were dying from cancer. She discovered that these illnesses were a result of the environment; Altgeld Gardens was built on top of a toxic landfill. This led her to found the People for Community Recovery, an environmental activist organization of concerned residents fighting for better conditions, in 1979. A movement leader, Johnson was invited to attend the first National People of Color Environmental Leadership Summit in 1992. It was at this summit where organizers first drafted and adopted the 17 Principles of Environmental Justice, and where Johnson was named the “mother of environmental justice”. Her tireless work earned her a Presidential Environment and Conservation Challenge Award in 1992, and a seat on the National Environmental Justice Advisory council; she was present in 1994 when President Clinton signed Executive Order 12898: “Federal Action to Address Environmental Justice in Minority Populations and Low-Income Populations,” which required federal agencies to “make achieving environmental justice part of [their] mission”35 for the first time.</p>

      <p>Unsurprisingly, Johnson appears as a footnote in the history of environmental activism if she’s there at all; few seem to care about the contributions a dark-skinned widowed mother of seven from the Southside Chicago projects, even as her contributions helped make the future of environmental justice possible. Thanks to digital storytelling, however, this is shifting. Help This Garden Grow36, an audio docuseries produced in partnership with the People for Community Recovery, tells Johnson’s story through interviews with many who worked with Johnson, including her daughter Cheryl, now the director of People for Community Recovery. The organization also created People for Community Recovery, a Virtual Tour of Altgeld Gardens37, a StoryMap-like virtual tour of Altgeld Gardens and the surrounding area narrated by Cheryl Johnson, linking neighborhood landmarks like Carver High School with sites like “Paxton Landfill” and “Former ACME Coke Plant”. The tour was originally created when the pandemic made in-person tours impossible, making these “toxic tours” accessible to everyone.</p>

      <p>BlackDH storytelling serves as an ideal format to experiment with afro-solarpunk worldbuilding. In response to the power relations of the world, in response to the impulse to enhance and transform the networks that link us, WILDWOOD uses digital storytelling as a tool of justice with digital methods of interactivity and choice to craft a dynamic text full of spirit, playtesting strategies for the future.</p>

      <p>WILDWOOD takes the player on a journey through a future version of Greater Englewood, combining player choice with ability check rolls to create randomness and luck. On face the project is straightforward—imagine a world and write it down, have players make choices and roll a virtual die, throw in images and maybe some audio if you’re fancy. Except, I’ve never played D&D as you know, but I also am not trained a creative writer, nor can I draw (and my audio production skills are beginner at best). Thus, building the project has been a series of digital methods lessons and experiments in itself.</p>

      <p>The story is written with Twine38, a platform for writing hyperlinked texts that often take the form of narrative games. After writing out the background to this world, text that ultimately became the game’s introduction, I outlined the various conflicts and choices that take place in the first chapter. This was done in a separate document mainly to have content to work with when I moved over to Twine, which I had to learn while writing (doing is often the best way to learn).</p>

      <p>When I finally began writing in Twine, I found that the process of narrative creation got easier. Hyperlinking is very simple, and it became much easier to write a continuous narrative that integrated player actions once I was in the mindset and the keystroke pattern of setting up challenges and creating possible solutions. Not unlike the real act of worldbuilding, we can theorize and plan endlessly but at some point we must act and react, and writing interactive fiction has been no different. As the story grew, and my Twine abilities grew, I was able to build in more complex UI mechanics such as rolls and stats.</p>

      <p>A unique content management system, I find Twine to be a really powerful platform that can be impactful at any scale and ability level. I’ve played some complex Twine stories, such as Parham’s Let Us Be Weightless, that combine narrative and media into a rich multimodal landscape. I have also played Twine stories comprised solely of words, such as Anna Anthropy’s Queers In Love At The End of The World39, that hit me harder in ten seconds than some novels do in 400 pages. Interactive fiction urgently pulls the reader into the world of the game, and the Twine platform makes building these dynamic texts pretty simple to do (though I’ll admit that having some HTML/CSS/ Javascript background makes Twine even easier).</p>

      <p>As I wrote, I used AI (DALL-E40, via Microsoft Copilot41) to generate imagery. This was and still is a very complicated choice for me as I am truly not sure where I stand on generative AI. The issues are numerous. I don’t like that publicly available artwork is scraped without attribution or compensation to populate training datasets (perhaps I am more sensitive to this compared to writing because I can’t draw, so I can only imagine how much work goes into creating digital art only for it to be sucked into DALL-E), and I find myself very compelled by projects like the Nightshade tool that work to poison image datasets by including invisible pixels that change how an image is processed, leading the program to produce incorrect images. It does not help that training datasets include images from all over the internet, meaning that harmful images like racist depictions and child sexual abuse imagery have appeared in some training datasets.</p>

      <p>Even at best, in a context where the dataset was cleaned and all of the included artists credited and compensated, generated art replicates existing aesthetics instead of creating anew. If a user prompts for an image of something that does not exist in the real world, the resulting image will be a mashup of images that already exist rather than a wholly new creation, which is kind of a semantic argument but can also lead to some confusingly weird images. For example, my prompts requesting afro-solarpunk buildings in Englewood, Chicago looked like a combination of the first Google Image result under “solarpunk” with the Chicago skyline in the background, because DALL-E combined images that matched with the key terms in my prompt. However, Englewood is nowhere near downtown, so an image of the neighborhood wouldn’t have the skyline in it. An artist sketching out afro-solarpunk buildings in Englewood would be able to capture the visual nuances of the neighborhood, catching those kinds of details, within the boundaries of that particular aesthetic, creating something new rather than combining pattern-matched results from a general database. At times I could only get DALL-E to produce a particular version of an image no matter how I rewrote the prompt, and I didn’t want to draw attention to an obvious mismatch between the narrative and the supporting imagery, so the story shifted to match the image. An AI generated image can only ever be as accurate as the relationship between the prompt and the training data, a visual approximation at absolute best.</p>

      <p>However, visual approximations are very useful tools for imagining new possibilities, especially if you can’t see them in your head or draw them out yourself. It was initially hard to start writing WILDWOOD because I’m not a creative writer by training, so narrative elements like setting descriptions were hard to imagine in my head. AI generated imagery helped inspire more detailed storytelling because it offered a descriptive starting point I could build upon. Broadly speaking, for every anti-AI artist I encountered, I found an artist embracing AI as a tool of speculative self-making and worldbuilding, because generative AI helps to eliminate creation barriers for folks without access to design & production infrastructure.</p>

      <p>This is a small snapshot of WILDWOOD as it currently exists. In chapter 1, you as the main character travel through a regular day, getting up and going to work. When you get to work, you learn that you’ve been promoted and are assigned a project that involves leaving Wildwood. Over the course of the chapter, you either begin planning for your trip or you go about your day as usual. You receive clues and tips about what may await you on your trip, but you either notice them or don’t (depending on how well you roll on awareness checks, one of your six character stats). As the day ends, you reflect on the day’s events and your upcoming trip, curious about what lies ahead or blissfully unaware.</p>

      <p>What lies ahead? You’ll find out in chapter 2.</p>
    
    <!-- part V -->
      <h2 id="proj-stmt-scrollspy-5">wild woods ::</h2>
      
      <p>What lies ahead for the WILDWOOD project? One of my first goals is figuring out an alternative to AI generated images created with publicly sourced data. I am imagining two options. I could go new school and build my own small dataset of purchased and credited solarpunk digital art with which to train an AI, a practice adopted by many Black digital and computational artists. This would also allow me to feed in my own images of Englewood to blend with the artwork, something I don’t feel comfortable doing with a public AI service (I generally try to avoid including any detailed or identifying details in my interactions with AI services). Or, I could go old school and just find a grant to hire a Black artist to create art for me. Blending the two options might be a future goal.</p>

      <p>Next is making improvements to the user interface. The dice rolling mechanism has been very finicky thus far, so streamlining the code is a main goal. I also want to make sure to achieve a healthy balance between player choice and dice rolls, as well as incorporating ways for players to level up their roll modifiers. Though this is primarily a thought experiment play-through, I would still like the game to be enjoyable as an experience. Broadly, this just means continuing to learn the Twine Sugarcube platform. I’m looking forward to adding features and media I can’t even think of yet as I learn how to use the platform better.</p>

      <p>Finally, and most importantly, I plan to continue building out the world of Wildwood, using conflict as narrative tool, both as a game mechanic and a worldbuilding mechanic. This is complex for me because Greater Englewood is a neighborhood already overdetermined by conflict, but increasingly I see this as the core of the project. There’s a part of me that wants to build a world with no fighting and no sadness, no guns and no police, but that isn’t a realistic vision of the future. Southside Chicago worldbuilding requires making sense of the bad alongside the good, because these survival strategies are critical to imagining a new future that can actually hold everybody.</p>

      <p>For, to quote Grow Greater Englewood steward Taryn Randle, Black digital worldbuilding means “working to try to secure a situation for our babies, to be able to further secure our future babies, no matter where they have to go, wherever they end up”.</p>
